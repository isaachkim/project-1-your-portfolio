## Hurdles and Unsolved Problems

- I started the css in a bad position. I used mediaqueries to adjust to a smaller screen instead of the other way around

- For my version2, I would like to change the way I used css

- I struggled with getting my button to work for my JavaScript but it was a simple fix that took hours to figure out.
